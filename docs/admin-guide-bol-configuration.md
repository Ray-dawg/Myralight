# Administrator's Guide to BOL System Configuration

## Introduction

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for configuring and managing the Bill of Lading (BOL) processing system. As an administrator, you'll be responsible for setting up the system, monitoring its operation, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
