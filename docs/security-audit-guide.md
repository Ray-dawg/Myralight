# Security Audit Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the security audit process for the Trucking SaaS Platform. Regular security audits help identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with security standards, and maintain the overall security posture of the application.

## Automated Security Scans

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The platform uses a GitHub Actions workflow to run automated security scans on a scheduled basis and on code changes. The workflow includes:

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Uses Snyk to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **OWASP ZAP API Scan**: Performs dynamic analysis to find security issues in the running application
3. **Static Code Analysis**: Uses SonarCloud to analyze code for security issues

### Running Scans Manually

To run security scans manually:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to the Actions tab
3. Select the "Security Scan" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"

Alternatively, you can run scans locally using the provided npm scripts:

```bash
# Run a comprehensive security audit
npm run security:scan

# Check dependencies only
npm run security:deps
```

## Security Dashboard

The application includes a Security Audit Dashboard accessible to administrators. The dashboard provides:

- Overall security score
- Vulnerability reports by severity
- Security event logs
- Audit history
- Scan results

To access the dashboard, log in as an administrator and navigate to Admin > Security Audit Dashboard.

## Manual Security Audit Process

### Preparation

1. **Define Scope**: Determine which components of the application will be audited
2. **Gather Documentation**: Collect relevant documentation, including architecture diagrams and data flow diagrams
3. **Assemble Team**: Identify team members who will participate in the audit

### Execution

1. **Authentication & Authorization Review**:
   - Review authentication mechanisms
   - Verify proper implementation of role-based access control
   - Check for secure session management

2. **Data Protection Review**:
   - Verify encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Review data access controls
   - Check for proper data sanitization and validation

3. **API Security Review**:
   - Verify API authentication and authorization
   - Check for rate limiting and other anti-abuse measures
   - Review input validation and output encoding

4. **Infrastructure Security Review**:
   - Review network security configurations
   - Check for secure deployment practices
   - Verify proper configuration of cloud services

5. **Code Review**:
   - Look for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Check for secure coding practices
   - Review third-party libraries and dependencies

### Reporting

1. **Document Findings**: Record all identified vulnerabilities and issues
2. **Assess Risk**: Assign severity levels to each finding
3. **Recommend Remediation**: Provide specific recommendations for addressing each issue
4. **Create Action Plan**: Develop a prioritized plan for implementing fixes

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat to sensitive data or system integrity; requires immediate attention
- **High**: Significant risk that could lead to system compromise; should be addressed within 1-2 weeks
- **Medium**: Moderate risk; should be addressed within 1 month
- **Low**: Minor risk; should be addressed within 3 months

### Remediation Process

1. **Triage**: Review and validate reported vulnerabilities
2. **Assign**: Assign vulnerabilities to appropriate team members
3. **Fix**: Implement fixes according to priority
4. **Verify**: Verify that fixes properly address the vulnerabilities
5. **Close**: Close the vulnerability report once verified

## Compliance Requirements

The security audit process helps ensure compliance with the following standards and regulations:

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
- SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) if applicable

## Tools and Resources

### Security Tools

- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **OWASP ZAP**: Dynamic application security testing
- **SonarCloud**: Static code analysis
- **npm audit**: Node.js package vulnerability scanning
